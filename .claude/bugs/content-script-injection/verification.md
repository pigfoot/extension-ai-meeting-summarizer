# Bug Verification

## Fix Implementation Summary
[To be completed after bug fix implementation]

## Test Results

### Original Bug Reproduction
- [x] **Before Fix**: Content script injection failure confirmed on multiple SharePoint pages
- [ ] **After Fix**: Bug no longer occurs - **PENDING IMPLEMENTATION**

### Reproduction Steps Verification
[Re-test the original steps that caused the bug]

1. Navigate to SharePoint meeting recording page - [x] **VERIFIED**: Pages load correctly
2. Check content script injection via DevTools - [x] **CONFIRMED**: No content script activity 
3. Test extension popup communication - [x] **CONFIRMED**: "Could not establish connection" error
4. Expected: Meeting detection and transcription capability - [x] **ACTUAL ERROR**: Complete functionality failure

### Diagnostic Results

#### Remote Debugging Analysis (2025-08-18)
**Test Environment**: 
- Browser: Microsoft Edge with remote debugging on port 9222
- Extension: Development build with HMR disabled for content scripts
- Pages Tested: AI Taskforce sync up + Consumer Weekly Meeting SharePoint recordings

**Content Script Status**:
- ❌ `chrome.runtime.onMessage` returns "no message listeners"  
- ❌ No global content script variables detected
- ❌ No console output from content script initialization
- ❌ Extension communication fails with "Receiving end does not exist"

**Page Analysis**:
- ✅ SharePoint URLs match content script patterns (`https://*.sharepoint.com/*`)
- ✅ Video elements present and accessible
- ✅ Meeting metadata available for extraction  
- ✅ Page loading completes (`document.readyState = "complete"`)

### Regression Testing
[Verify related functionality still works]

- [x] **Extension Popup Loading**: Works correctly, UI renders properly
- [x] **Background Script Operation**: Service worker initializes and processes messages  
- [x] **Azure Speech Configuration**: API settings accessible and configurable
- [x] **Storage Operations**: Chrome Storage API functions correctly
- [ ] **SharePoint Content Detection**: **BLOCKED** - Cannot test without content script injection

### Edge Case Testing
[Test boundary conditions and edge cases]

- [ ] **Different SharePoint Tenants**: Cannot test without basic injection working
- [ ] **Various Meeting Recording Formats**: Cannot test without content script
- [ ] **Network/Authentication Edge Cases**: Cannot test SharePoint-specific scenarios
- [ ] **Page Reload/Navigation**: **OBSERVED** - Page reload does not restore content script injection

## Code Quality Checks

### Automated Tests
- [x] **Unit Tests**: All non-SharePoint tests passing
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Background script and popup tests passing  
- [x] **Linting**: Content script code passes lint checks
- [x] **Type Checking**: No TypeScript errors in content script

### Manual Code Review
- [x] **Manifest Configuration**: Content script patterns appear correct
- [x] **Bundle Generation**: `dist/content/all.iife.js` builds successfully (~1.8MB)
- [x] **File Permissions**: All content script files accessible and readable
- [x] **URL Pattern Matching**: Patterns should match SharePoint domains

## Deployment Verification

### Pre-deployment
- [x] **Local Development**: Extension loads in browser successfully
- [x] **File Structure**: All required content script files present in dist/
- [x] **Build Process**: Content script compilation completes without errors

### Post-deployment
- [ ] **Content Script Injection**: **FAILED** - Scripts not executing on target pages
- [ ] **Error Monitoring**: Clean browser console except for injection failure
- [ ] **User Workflow**: **COMPLETELY BLOCKED** - Core functionality unavailable

## Investigation Status

### Completed Diagnostics
- [x] **Remote Debugging Setup**: Chrome DevTools Protocol access established
- [x] **Multi-page Testing**: Confirmed issue across different SharePoint meeting pages  
- [x] **Manifest Analysis**: Content script configuration reviewed and appears correct
- [x] **Bundle Verification**: Built content script files exist and are accessible
- [x] **Communication Testing**: Background script and popup communication verified working

### Outstanding Questions
- [ ] **Injection Timing**: Is the content script attempting to inject but failing?
- [ ] **SharePoint CSP**: Does SharePoint Content Security Policy block script execution?
- [ ] **Chrome Extension Context**: Are there Manifest v3 context isolation issues?
- [ ] **Development Mode Issues**: Do extension reloads properly reinject content scripts?

### Next Steps for Resolution
1. **Enhanced Diagnostic Script**: Create minimal content script with extensive logging
2. **Manual Injection Testing**: Use DevTools to manually test script injection
3. **Alternative Injection Methods**: Test programmatic injection via background script
4. **Manifest Configuration Variants**: Try different content script configurations

## Closure Checklist
- [ ] **Original issue resolved**: Content script injection working on SharePoint pages
- [ ] **No regressions introduced**: All other extension functionality intact
- [ ] **Tests passing**: SharePoint detection tests added and passing
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: Content script architecture documented
- [ ] **Stakeholders notified**: Development team informed of resolution

## Notes
This bug represents a critical blocker for the extension's primary use case. The content script injection failure prevents all SharePoint-specific functionality, making the extension non-functional for its intended purpose. Resolution requires immediate attention and comprehensive testing across multiple SharePoint environments.

**Priority**: Critical - Core functionality completely unavailable
**Estimated Impact**: 100% of SharePoint use cases affected
**Technical Debt**: May indicate broader Chrome Extension v3 architecture issues requiring review
