After clicking "üé§ Start Audio Capture" on a SharePoint page with meeting recordings:
1. SharePoint recording should be detected ‚úÖ (working)
2. Transcription job should be created ‚úÖ (working)  
3. Audio capture should initialize and begin processing
4. Progress should advance from 0% as audio is captured and sent to Azure Speech Service
5. Job status should progress from "initializing" to actively processing audio
6. **UI should show progress advancing**: 0% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 75% ‚Üí 100%
7. **Azure Speech Service should process the audio**: Convert speech to text
8. **Final completion state**: 
   - UI shows 100% completion status
   - Transcription results visible in extension popup
   - Background logs show successful Azure Speech Service transcription
   - Complete meeting transcript available for user
