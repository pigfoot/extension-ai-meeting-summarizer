# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Azure Speech Integration provides direct integration with Azure Cognitive Services Speech SDK for transcribing SharePoint meeting recordings. This system implements batch transcription with direct URL processing, eliminating the need to download large audio files while providing reliable speech-to-text conversion for the Meeting Summarizer extension.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This integration directly supports the product vision by:
- **Core Functionality**: Enables the primary transcription capability for Teams meeting recordings
- **Enterprise Efficiency**: Processes recordings directly from SharePoint URLs without downloads
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports various languages for global corporate environments
- **Privacy Protection**: Processes audio through Azure while keeping results local

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Azure Speech SDK Client

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust Azure Speech SDK client that handles authentication and API communication, so that the extension can reliably transcribe meeting recordings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the client THEN the system SHALL create SpeechConfig with subscription key and region from storage
2. WHEN configuring speech recognition THEN the system SHALL support language selection, output format, and confidence thresholds
3. WHEN handling API authentication THEN the system SHALL implement automatic token refresh and error recovery
4. WHEN managing API quotas THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent quota exceeded errors

### Requirement 2: Direct URL Transcription

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to transcribe SharePoint audio URLs directly, so that I don't need to download large meeting files to my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a SharePoint audio URL THEN the system SHALL use Azure batch transcription with --input URL parameter
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL support files up to 2GB in size without timeout
3. WHEN handling various formats THEN the system SHALL support MP4, WAV, MP3, and other common meeting formats
4. WHEN detecting stereo audio THEN the system SHALL automatically enable speaker diarization for multi-participant meetings

### Requirement 3: Batch Transcription Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive batch transcription job management, so that long-running transcription jobs are handled reliably with proper progress tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting transcription jobs THEN the system SHALL create TranscriptionJob with unique ID and status tracking
2. WHEN monitoring job progress THEN the system SHALL poll Azure API for status updates with exponential backoff
3. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL retrieve detailed results with speaker information and timestamps
4. WHEN jobs fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with maximum attempt limits and error categorization

### Requirement 4: Multi-language Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to support transcription in multiple languages, so that I can process meetings conducted in different languages for global teams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring language THEN the system SHALL support at least English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, and German
2. WHEN detecting language automatically THEN the system SHALL provide language detection for unknown audio content
3. WHEN transcribing mixed-language content THEN the system SHALL handle code-switching in international meetings
4. WHEN formatting results THEN the system SHALL preserve language-specific formatting and character encoding

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want robust error handling that gracefully manages API failures and network issues, so that temporary problems don't lose my transcription work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering network failures THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry with maximum 5 attempts
2. WHEN facing quota limits THEN the system SHALL queue jobs and notify users of retry schedules
3. WHEN detecting invalid audio URLs THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with resolution guidance
4. WHEN experiencing service outages THEN the system SHALL store job information for automatic retry when service recovers

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Transcription job submission SHALL complete within 5 seconds
- Job status polling SHALL occur every 30 seconds with exponential backoff
- Result retrieval SHALL complete within 10 seconds for completed jobs
- System SHALL support up to 10 concurrent transcription jobs

### Security
- API credentials SHALL be stored encrypted and never logged in plain text
- All Azure API communications SHALL use HTTPS with certificate validation
- Audio URLs SHALL be validated to prevent SSRF attacks
- API keys SHALL be rotated according to security best practices

### Reliability
- System SHALL achieve 99.5% success rate for valid audio URLs
- Transcription jobs SHALL not be lost due to browser restarts
- Failed jobs SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting
- System SHALL gracefully handle Azure service maintenance windows

### Usability
- Transcription progress SHALL be visible to users with estimated completion time
- Error messages SHALL provide actionable guidance for common issues
- System SHALL provide audio quality feedback and optimization suggestions
- Configuration SHALL include test functionality to validate API setup
