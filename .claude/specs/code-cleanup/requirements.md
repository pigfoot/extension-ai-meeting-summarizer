# Code Cleanup and Quality Improvement Requirements

## Overview
After completing all core feature implementations, perform comprehensive code cleanup to ensure production-ready code quality and maintainability.

## Scope
This specification covers post-implementation code quality improvements, linting rule restoration, and final code cleanup tasks that should be performed after all feature development is complete.

## Requirements

### 1. ESLint Rules Restoration
- **R1.1**: Restore strict ESLint unused variable rules by removing underscore prefix allowance
- **R1.2**: Fix all resulting unused variable violations with proper code cleanup
- **R1.3**: Ensure no legitimate unused variables remain after cleanup
- **R1.4**: Validate that all packages still build successfully after rule restoration

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- **R2.1**: Remove any remaining `any` types and replace with proper TypeScript types
- **R2.2**: Eliminate dead code and unused imports across all packages
- **R2.3**: Ensure consistent code formatting across the entire codebase
- **R2.4**: Validate all function and variable names follow project conventions

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **R3.1**: Review and optimize bundle sizes for production builds
- **R3.2**: Eliminate unnecessary dependencies and imports
- **R3.3**: Optimize webpack and build configurations for production
- **R3.4**: Ensure optimal tree-shaking for all packages

### 4. Documentation Cleanup
- **R4.1**: Update all JSDoc comments to reflect final implementations
- **R4.2**: Remove any outdated TODO comments and replace with proper tracking
- **R4.3**: Ensure all public APIs have comprehensive documentation
- **R4.4**: Validate that README files are accurate and up-to-date

### 5. Final Validation
- **R5.1**: Run comprehensive linting across all packages
- **R5.2**: Ensure all TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **R5.3**: Validate cross-browser build compatibility
- **R5.4**: Confirm production build optimization and minification

## Success Criteria
- Zero ESLint errors or warnings across all packages
- All TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode enabled
- No unused variables, imports, or dead code remains
- All packages build successfully for production deployment
- Code quality metrics meet enterprise standards
