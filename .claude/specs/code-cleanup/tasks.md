# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
The code cleanup implementation performs systematic code quality improvements and ESLint rule restoration after all core features are completed. This approach ensures production-ready code quality through automated cleanup, manual review, and comprehensive validation.

## Steering Document Compliance
Tasks follow structure.md conventions by maintaining existing package organization while improving code quality. Tech.md alignment is maintained through proper TypeScript strict mode compliance and ESLint configuration restoration according to project standards.

## Prerequisites
**CRITICAL: This specification should ONLY be executed after all other specs are 100% complete:**
- ✅ foundation-layer (20/20 tasks)
- ✅ azure-speech-integration (39/39 tasks)  
- ✅ background-service (28/28 tasks)
- ✅ content-detection (28/28 tasks)
- ✅ storage-configuration (24/24 tasks)
- ❌ content-scripts (0/28 tasks) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
- ❌ ui-architecture (0/28 tasks) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
- ❌ meeting-processing (0/28 tasks) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
- ❌ testing-qa (0/28 tasks) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**

**Total Remaining**: 112 tasks across 4 specs must be completed before code cleanup

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts, path/to/component.tsx_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode
- [ ] No unused variables, imports, or dead code remains
- [ ] Production builds succeed for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
