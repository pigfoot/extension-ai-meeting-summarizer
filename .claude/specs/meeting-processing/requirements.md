## Introduction

The Meeting Processing System provides AI-powered analysis of transcribed meeting content to generate intelligent summaries, extract action items, identify key decisions, and structure meeting outcomes for easy consumption. This system transforms raw transcription text into valuable business insights and actionable information.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This processing system directly supports the product vision by:
- **Actionable Insights**: Converts lengthy transcriptions into focused summaries and clear action items
- **Productivity Enhancement**: Reduces time spent reviewing meeting recordings by 70% through intelligent summarization
- **Decision Tracking**: Identifies and highlights key decisions made during meetings for better accountability
- **Knowledge Retention**: Creates structured meeting archives that support organizational learning and follow-up

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Meeting Summarization

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-generated meeting summaries that capture the essential content and outcomes, so that I can quickly understand what happened without reading full transcriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transcription text THEN the system SHALL generate concise summaries highlighting main topics, decisions, and outcomes
2. WHEN analyzing meeting flow THEN the system SHALL identify key discussion points and structure them logically
3. WHEN handling long meetings THEN the system SHALL create hierarchical summaries with overview and detailed sections
4. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy while removing filler words, tangents, and repetitive content

### Requirement 2: Action Item Extraction

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automatic extraction of action items with assigned parties and deadlines, so that I can track follow-up tasks and ensure accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing transcriptions THEN the system SHALL identify action items using natural language patterns and commitment indicators
2. WHEN extracting assignments THEN the system SHALL attempt to identify responsible parties from speaker identification and context
3. WHEN detecting deadlines THEN the system SHALL recognize date references and time commitments mentioned in discussions
4. WHEN categorizing items THEN the system SHALL assign priority levels based on language intensity and context importance

### Requirement 3: Key Decision Identification

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want clear identification of decisions made during meetings, so that I can track what was agreed upon and communicate outcomes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing discussions THEN the system SHALL identify decision points using language patterns and consensus indicators

3. WHEN extracting context THEN the system SHALL capture the reasoning and factors that led to each decision
4. WHEN presenting decisions THEN the system SHALL highlight decision owners and implementation implications

### Requirement 4: Multi-language Content Processing

**User Story:** As a global team member, I want the system to process meetings conducted in different languages, so that I can get summaries regardless of the meeting language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing non-English content THEN the system SHALL provide accurate summarization in the original language
2. WHEN handling mixed-language meetings THEN the system SHALL process content appropriately while maintaining context
3. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL preserve language-specific terminology and cultural context
