# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
The meeting processing implementation creates a dedicated packages/meeting-processor package with AI-powered content analysis, summarization, action item extraction, and decision identification. This approach focuses on local processing without external AI dependencies while providing enterprise-grade accuracy and reliability for meeting content analysis.

## Steering Document Compliance
Tasks follow structure.md conventions by creating a new packages/meeting-processor service package with documented naming patterns. Tech.md alignment is maintained through local AI processing patterns, privacy protection requirements, and integration with existing storage and UI systems for processed results.

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts, path/to/component.tsx_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles
