# Implementation Plan

## Task Overview
The storage configuration implementation extends existing packages/storage infrastructure with meeting-specific storage services, secure Azure API configuration management, intelligent caching, and cross-browser synchronization. This approach builds upon established storage base classes and patterns while adding enterprise-grade data management capabilities.

## Steering Document Compliance
Tasks follow structure.md conventions by extending packages/storage with meeting-specific modules, using documented kebab-case naming for services. Tech.md patterns are maintained by leveraging existing Chrome Storage API integration and implementing documented security practices for credential management.

## Atomic Task Requirements
**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines
- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts, path/to/component.tsx_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles
