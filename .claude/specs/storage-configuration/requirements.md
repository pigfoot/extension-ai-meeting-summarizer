# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Storage Configuration System enhances the existing Chrome Storage foundation to support meeting transcription data, Azure Speech API configuration management, and intelligent caching for the Meeting Summarizer extension. This system builds upon the established storage package while adding meeting-specific storage capabilities.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This storage system directly supports the product vision by:
- **Local Privacy**: Ensures meeting transcriptions remain stored locally, addressing corporate privacy concerns
- **Performance Optimization**: Provides intelligent caching to reduce Azure API calls and improve response times
- **Seamless Configuration**: Enables easy Azure Speech API setup for enterprise users
- **Data Persistence**: Maintains meeting archives for searchable organizational knowledge retention

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Meeting Data Storage Schema

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive data schema for storing meeting transcriptions, summaries, and metadata, so that meeting data is organized and easily retrievable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing a meeting transcription THEN the system SHALL save MeetingRecord with transcription, summary, metadata, and timestamps
2. WHEN retrieving meeting data THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access to TranscriptionResult, MeetingSummary, and ActionItem objects
3. WHEN managing meeting archives THEN the system SHALL support efficient querying by date, participants, or keywords
4. WHEN storing large transcriptions THEN the system SHALL implement data compression to optimize storage usage

### Requirement 2: Azure API Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure storage and management of my Azure Speech API credentials, so that I can configure the extension once and have it work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing API credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt Azure subscription keys using Chrome Storage encryption
2. WHEN configuring API settings THEN the system SHALL validate Azure region, language, and output format selections
3. WHEN accessing stored configuration THEN the system SHALL provide secure retrieval with automatic key decryption
4. WHEN updating credentials THEN the system SHALL provide atomic updates to prevent configuration corruption

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Transcription Caching

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to cache transcription results intelligently, so that I don't waste Azure API credits re-processing the same meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a SharePoint URL THEN the system SHALL check cache using URL hash before calling Azure API
2. WHEN cache reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL implement LRU eviction to maintain performance
3. WHEN retrieving cached results THEN the system SHALL validate cache integrity and freshness
4. WHEN clearing cache THEN the system SHALL provide selective or complete cache management options

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Storage Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my meeting archives and settings to sync across my browsers, so that I can access my data from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enabling sync THEN the system SHALL use Chrome Storage sync API for configuration and preferences
2. WHEN managing large transcriptions THEN the system SHALL store transcription data locally while syncing metadata only
3. WHEN detecting sync conflicts THEN the system SHALL implement last-write-wins resolution with user notification
4. WHEN working offline THEN the system SHALL queue sync operations for when connection is restored

### Requirement 5: Storage Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized storage operations that don't impact extension performance, so that users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing storage operations THEN the system SHALL implement batched writes to minimize I/O operations
2. WHEN reading frequently accessed data THEN the system SHALL provide in-memory caching layer
3. WHEN managing storage quotas THEN the system SHALL monitor usage and provide cleanup recommendations
4. WHEN detecting storage errors THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Storage operations SHALL complete within 100ms for cached data
- Cache lookup SHALL complete within 10ms for URL hash queries
- Batch operations SHALL process up to 50 records without blocking UI
- Memory usage SHALL not exceed 50MB for in-memory cache

### Security
- API keys SHALL be encrypted using Chrome Storage encryption APIs
- Meeting transcriptions SHALL never be transmitted outside user's device
- Storage operations SHALL validate data integrity using checksums
- Configuration access SHALL require proper extension context

### Reliability
- Storage SHALL provide ACID properties for configuration updates
- Cache SHALL maintain consistency across browser restarts
- System SHALL recover gracefully from storage quota exceeded errors
- Data migration SHALL preserve existing meeting archives during updates

### Usability
- Storage errors SHALL provide clear user-facing error messages
- Cache statistics SHALL be available for user monitoring
- Storage cleanup SHALL provide size impact estimates before execution
- Configuration validation SHALL provide real-time feedback
