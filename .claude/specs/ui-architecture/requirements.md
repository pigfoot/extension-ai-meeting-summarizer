# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UI Architecture provides the complete user interface system for the Meeting Summarizer extension, built on React 19.1.1 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. This system includes the popup interface, options page, progress indicators, meeting summary displays, and responsive design components that create a cohesive user experience.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This UI architecture directly supports the product vision by:
- **Professional Interface**: Provides enterprise-grade UI suitable for corporate environments
- **Intuitive Workflow**: Creates seamless user experience from transcription initiation to summary review
- **Quick Access**: Enables rapid access to meeting summaries and action items through popup interface
- **Configuration Management**: Provides comprehensive Azure API and preference management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Extension Popup Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive popup interface that shows transcription status, recent meetings, and quick access to summaries, so that I can manage my meeting transcriptions efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the popup THEN the system SHALL display current transcription jobs with progress indicators and estimated completion times
2. WHEN viewing recent meetings THEN the system SHALL show a chronological list with meeting titles, dates, and transcription status
3. WHEN accessing summaries THEN the system SHALL provide quick preview with expand options for full summaries and action items
4. WHEN managing jobs THEN the system SHALL provide controls to pause, resume, or cancel active transcription jobs

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Options Page

**User Story:** As a user, I want a detailed options page where I can configure Azure API settings, manage preferences, and control extension behavior, so that I can customize the extension for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Azure API THEN the system SHALL provide secure input fields for subscription key, region, and language preferences
2. WHEN managing storage THEN the system SHALL display storage usage statistics and provide cleanup options
3. WHEN setting preferences THEN the system SHALL offer options for auto-transcription, notification settings, and summary formats
4. WHEN testing configuration THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools to verify Azure API connectivity and settings

### Requirement 3: Progress Monitoring System

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback about transcription progress and system status, so that I understand what the extension is doing and when it will complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are running THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress bars with percentage completion and time estimates
2. WHEN multiple jobs are active THEN the system SHALL show individual progress for each transcription with clear identification
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested resolution actions
4. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL show completion notifications with summary preview options

### Requirement 4: Meeting Summary Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want well-organized displays of meeting summaries, action items, and key decisions, so that I can quickly review and act on meeting outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying summaries THEN the system SHALL organize content into sections for overview, key points, action items, and decisions
2. WHEN showing action items THEN the system SHALL highlight assigned parties, deadlines, and priority levels with visual indicators
3. WHEN presenting transcriptions THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, scrollable text with speaker identification and timestamps
4. WHEN exporting content THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including text, structured data, and printable summaries

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design System

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual design that works well across different screen sizes and interface contexts, so that the extension looks professional and functions properly everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria
