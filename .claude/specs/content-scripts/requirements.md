# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Scripts System provides the browser-side integration layer that injects functionality into SharePoint and Teams pages. This system handles DOM manipulation, user interface integration, event handling, and serves as the bridge between webpage content and the extension's background services.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This content script system directly supports the product vision by:
- **Seamless Integration**: Provides native-feeling integration within existing SharePoint/Teams workflows
- **User Experience**: Enables one-click transcription directly from meeting pages without disrupting user flow
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains awareness of page content and meeting context for intelligent feature activation
- **Corporate Compatibility**: Works within existing enterprise web applications without conflicts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Page-Specific Content Injection

**User Story:** As a user, I want transcription controls to appear naturally within SharePoint and Teams interfaces, so that the extension feels like a native part of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting SharePoint meeting pages THEN the system SHALL inject transcription controls in contextually appropriate locations
2. WHEN navigating Teams interfaces THEN the system SHALL adapt UI placement based on page layout and content structure
3. WHEN pages update dynamically THEN the system SHALL maintain UI consistency and respond to layout changes
4. WHEN multiple meetings are present THEN the system SHALL provide individual controls for each discoverable recording

### Requirement 2: DOM Manipulation and Event Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust DOM manipulation that works reliably across different page layouts and updates, so that the extension remains functional as Microsoft updates their interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring page changes THEN the system SHALL use MutationObserver to detect relevant DOM updates efficiently
2. WHEN injecting UI elements THEN the system SHALL use safe DOM insertion techniques that don't interfere with existing functionality
3. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL properly capture and process click, hover, and keyboard events
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove all injected elements and event listeners to prevent memory leaks

### Requirement 3: Background Service Communication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable communication between content scripts and background services, so that user actions trigger appropriate transcription workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users initiate transcription THEN the system SHALL send structured messages to background service with meeting context
2. WHEN receiving progress updates THEN the system SHALL update injected UI elements to reflect current transcription status
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error states and recovery options in the page UI
4. WHEN managing multiple tabs THEN the system SHALL coordinate with background service to maintain consistent state

### Requirement 4: Context-Aware Feature Activation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to intelligently show relevant features based on page content, so that I only see transcription options when they're applicable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing page content THEN the system SHALL detect meeting recordings and their accessibility status
2. WHEN evaluating user permissions THEN the system SHALL show appropriate controls based on user access rights
3. WHEN detecting content changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically show or hide features as content becomes available
4. WHEN handling loading states THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback while content is being analyzed

### Requirement 5: Cross-Browser Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent extension behavior across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers, so that my experience is the same regardless of browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in Chrome THEN the system SHALL use Chrome extension APIs with full feature support
2. WHEN running in Firefox THEN the system SHALL adapt to Firefox extension API differences and limitations
3. WHEN running in Edge THEN the system SHALL leverage Chromium compatibility while handling Edge-specific behaviors
4. WHEN detecting browser differences THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate fallbacks and feature adaptation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Content script injection SHALL complete within 1 second of page load
- DOM manipulation SHALL not cause visible layout shifts or performance degradation
- Memory usage SHALL remain under 10MB per injected page
- Event handling SHALL respond within 100ms of user interaction

### Security
- DOM injection SHALL sanitize all content to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- Message passing SHALL validate all communication with background service
- User data SHALL never be exposed to webpage JavaScript contexts
- External resource loading SHALL be properly restricted by CSP

### Reliability
- Content scripts SHALL handle webpage JavaScript errors gracefully without failing
- UI injection SHALL work across different SharePoint themes and customizations
- System SHALL recover from DOM manipulation conflicts with other extensions
- Feature detection SHALL provide graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable

### Usability
- Injected UI SHALL match the visual style and theme of the host webpage
- Controls SHALL be discoverable but not intrusive to existing workflows
- Loading states SHALL provide clear feedback during transcription processing
- Error messages SHALL be contextual and provide actionable guidance
