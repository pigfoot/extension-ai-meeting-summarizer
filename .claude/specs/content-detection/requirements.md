# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Detection System identifies SharePoint and Teams pages containing meeting recordings and extracts audio/video URLs for transcription processing. This system serves as the entry point for the Meeting Summarizer extension, automatically detecting when users are viewing transcribable content.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This detection system directly supports the product vision by:
- **Automatic Discovery**: Enables seamless detection of Teams meeting recordings without manual input
- **SharePoint Integration**: Works with existing corporate infrastructure where recordings are stored
- **User Experience**: Provides automatic detection that fits naturally into existing meeting workflows
- **Broad Compatibility**: Supports various SharePoint and Teams page formats across different tenants

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: SharePoint Page Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to automatically detect when I'm viewing a SharePoint page with meeting recordings, so that I can easily access transcription features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting a SharePoint site THEN the system SHALL detect sharepoint.com domains and subdomain variations
2. WHEN analyzing page content THEN the system SHALL identify meeting recording indicators in page metadata and content
3. WHEN detecting multiple recordings THEN the system SHALL enumerate all available meeting files on the page
4. WHEN pages load dynamically THEN the system SHALL monitor DOM changes to detect newly loaded recording content

### Requirement 2: Teams Meeting Page Recognition

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work with Teams meeting pages and Teams web interface, so that I can transcribe recordings from multiple access points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Teams web interface THEN the system SHALL detect teams.microsoft.com domains and meeting contexts
2. WHEN viewing meeting details THEN the system SHALL identify recording availability and access permissions
3. WHEN navigating Teams channels THEN the system SHALL detect embedded meeting recordings in chat history
4. WHEN handling Teams deep links THEN the system SHALL resolve links to actual recording content

### Requirement 3: Audio/Video URL Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust URL extraction that finds direct links to audio and video files, so that Azure Speech API can process recordings without downloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing page content THEN the system SHALL extract direct URLs to MP4, WAV, MP3, and other supported formats
2. WHEN encountering streaming content THEN the system SHALL resolve manifest URLs to actual media streams
3. WHEN handling protected content THEN the system SHALL extract URLs while preserving authentication tokens
4. WHEN validating URLs THEN the system SHALL verify accessibility and format compatibility before processing

### Requirement 4: Meeting Metadata Extraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to capture meeting information like title, date, and participants, so that transcriptions are properly organized and searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting meetings THEN the system SHALL extract meeting title, date, duration, and organizer information
2. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL capture participant lists and attendee information
3. WHEN parsing content THEN the system SHALL identify meeting topics and agenda items from page content
4. WHEN structuring data THEN the system SHALL format metadata according to MeetingDetection interface specifications

### Requirement 5: Cross-Tenant Compatibility

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want the extension to work across different Microsoft tenant configurations, so that it functions regardless of my organization's SharePoint setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering custom domains THEN the system SHALL detect SharePoint sites with custom domain configurations
2. WHEN handling different versions THEN the system SHALL support SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2019, and SharePoint 2016
3. WHEN accessing various regions THEN the system SHALL work with international SharePoint deployments and localization
4. WHEN dealing with permissions THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle access restrictions and authentication requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page analysis SHALL complete within 2 seconds of page load
- URL extraction SHALL process up to 50 potential media links per page
- DOM monitoring SHALL have minimal impact on page performance (<5ms overhead)
- Detection accuracy SHALL achieve >95% for valid meeting pages

### Security
- URL extraction SHALL validate domains to prevent malicious redirects
- Authentication tokens SHALL be preserved but never logged or stored permanently
- Page analysis SHALL respect CSP restrictions and not inject external resources
- User permissions SHALL be validated before attempting URL access

### Reliability
- Detection SHALL work consistently across browser versions and SharePoint updates
- System SHALL gracefully handle page structure changes and layout updates
- URL extraction SHALL provide fallback methods for different content organization patterns
- Error handling SHALL provide clear feedback when content is inaccessible

### Usability
- Detection status SHALL be visible to users through extension UI indicators
- False positives SHALL be minimized to avoid user confusion
- System SHALL provide clear messaging when recordings are detected but inaccessible
- Detection SHALL work seamlessly without requiring user configuration
