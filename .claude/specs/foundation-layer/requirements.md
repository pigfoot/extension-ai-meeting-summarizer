# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Foundation Layer establishes the core infrastructure for the Meeting Summarizer Chrome Extension v3. This layer provides the monorepo structure, TypeScript types system, Chrome Extension manifest configuration, and cross-browser compatibility framework that all other components will build upon.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This foundation layer directly supports the product vision by:
- **Enabling Multi-Browser Support**: Ensures the extension works across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox to reach all corporate users
- **Establishing Scalable Architecture**: Provides the monorepo structure needed for managing multiple extension components
- **Ensuring Type Safety**: Creates the TypeScript foundation required for robust Azure Speech API integration
- **Supporting Corporate Deployment**: Provides the extension framework needed for enterprise-grade distribution

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Monorepo Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete monorepo structure with proper package organization, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain the Meeting Summarizer extension components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide a complete Turborepo configuration with all extension-specific packages
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL support incremental builds and effective caching for faster development cycles
3. WHEN adding new packages THEN the system SHALL automatically handle inter-package dependencies and build orchestration
4. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL provide hot module replacement for all extension pages

### Requirement 2: Meeting Summarizer Type System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for meeting data, Azure Speech API, and extension components, so that I can develop with type safety and clear interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining meeting transcription data THEN the system SHALL provide strong type definitions for TranscriptionResult, MeetingSummary, and ActionItem
2. WHEN integrating with Azure Speech API THEN the system SHALL provide typed interfaces for AzureSpeechConfig, SpeechClient, and API responses
3. WHEN developing extension components THEN the system SHALL provide shared types for Chrome Storage schemas, extension messaging, and UI components
4. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL enforce strict TypeScript checking across all packages

### Requirement 3: Chrome Extension Manifest v3 Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to use the latest Chrome Extension Manifest v3 standard, so that it works reliably in modern browsers and follows current security practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the extension THEN the system SHALL use Manifest v3 format with proper service worker configuration
2. WHEN requesting permissions THEN the system SHALL follow minimum privilege principle, only requesting storage, scripting, tabs, and notifications permissions
3. WHEN running background tasks THEN the system SHALL use Service Worker instead of persistent background pages
4. WHEN accessing external resources THEN the system SHALL implement proper Content Security Policy for Azure Speech API endpoints

### Requirement 4: Cross-Browser Compatibility Framework

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to work consistently across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers, so that I can use the Meeting Summarizer regardless of my preferred browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for Chrome THEN the system SHALL generate a Chrome-compatible extension package with standard Manifest v3
2. WHEN building for Firefox THEN the system SHALL generate a Firefox-compatible package with browser_specific_settings and gecko compatibility
3. WHEN building for Edge THEN the system SHALL generate an Edge-compatible package using Chromium-based configuration
4. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support testing across all target browsers

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Storage Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an enhanced storage system that supports meeting data, transcription results, and configuration management, so that I can build upon existing storage capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing meeting transcriptions THEN the system SHALL extend existing storage with meeting-specific data structures
2. WHEN managing Azure API configuration THEN the system SHALL provide secure configuration storage with encryption capabilities
3. WHEN caching transcription results THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache management for performance optimization
4. WHEN syncing across browsers THEN the system SHALL support Chrome Storage sync for user preferences

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Build time for complete project SHALL NOT exceed 45 seconds
- Development mode hot reload SHALL complete within 3 seconds
- Extension bundle size SHALL remain under 8MB total across all components
- TypeScript compilation SHALL complete in under 15 seconds

### Security
- Content Security Policy SHALL restrict external connections to only Azure Speech API endpoints
- Extension permissions SHALL follow principle of least privilege
- API keys and sensitive configuration SHALL be stored with encryption in Chrome Storage
- All external resource requests SHALL be explicitly defined in manifest

### Reliability
- Extension SHALL support Chrome 109+, Firefox 109+, and Edge 109+
- Build system SHALL provide consistent results across development environments
- Extension SHALL gracefully handle browser API differences across platforms
- Storage system SHALL provide data integrity and corruption prevention

### Usability
- Development environment SHALL provide clear error messages for common configuration issues
- Build system SHALL provide progress indicators for long-running operations
- Type system SHALL provide helpful IntelliSense and auto-completion
- Documentation SHALL be automatically generated from TypeScript interfaces
