# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Background Service Architecture provides the central orchestration layer for the Meeting Summarizer extension using Chrome Extension Manifest v3 Service Worker. This system coordinates transcription jobs, manages cross-tab communication, handles storage operations, and serves as the communication hub between all extension components.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This background service directly supports the product vision by:
- **Reliable Processing**: Ensures transcription jobs continue even when tabs are closed or browser is minimized
- **Seamless Coordination**: Manages complex workflows between content detection, Azure API calls, and UI updates
- **Performance Optimization**: Handles resource-intensive operations without blocking user interface
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Provides robust job management suitable for corporate environments

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Service Worker Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust Service Worker that handles Chrome Extension v3 lifecycle properly, so that the extension remains functional and responsive across browser sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension starts THEN the Service Worker SHALL initialize all required subsystems and restore active jobs
2. WHEN browser enters idle state THEN the Service Worker SHALL persist critical state and gracefully suspend operations
3. WHEN Service Worker awakens THEN the system SHALL restore job queues and resume pending transcriptions
4. WHEN handling termination THEN the system SHALL save all progress and ensure no data loss

### Requirement 2: Transcription Job Orchestration

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable job management that handles multiple transcription requests efficiently, so that my meeting processing doesn't get lost or duplicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving transcription requests THEN the system SHALL create unique TranscriptionJob entries with proper status tracking
2. WHEN managing job queues THEN the system SHALL implement priority queuing with concurrent processing limits
3. WHEN jobs are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates to all listening components
4. WHEN jobs complete or fail THEN the system SHALL update storage and notify relevant UI components

### Requirement 3: Cross-Tab Communication Hub

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent extension behavior across multiple browser tabs, so that starting transcription in one tab updates all other extension interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content scripts detect meetings THEN the system SHALL broadcast detection events to all extension contexts
2. WHEN transcription progress updates THEN the system SHALL synchronize progress across popup, options, and content interfaces
3. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL propagate updates to all active components immediately
4. WHEN managing conflicts THEN the system SHALL implement proper message routing and prevent race conditions

### Requirement 4: Azure API Integration Coordination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized Azure API management that handles authentication, rate limiting, and error recovery, so that all components have reliable access to transcription services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making Azure API calls THEN the system SHALL manage authentication tokens and automatic renewal
2. WHEN handling rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent queuing and backoff strategies
3. WHEN processing multiple jobs THEN the system SHALL coordinate API calls to prevent quota exhaustion
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and provide detailed error reporting

### Requirement 5: Storage and Cache Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized storage management that coordinates between cache, persistent storage, and sync operations, so that data integrity is maintained across all storage layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing transcription results THEN the system SHALL coordinate between cache, local storage, and sync storage
2. WHEN handling storage quotas THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cleanup and user notification
3. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use batched operations to prevent blocking
4. WHEN detecting conflicts THEN the system SHALL implement proper conflict resolution strategies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Service Worker startup SHALL complete within 3 seconds including state restoration
- Message passing between components SHALL have <50ms latency
- Job queue processing SHALL handle up to 20 concurrent transcription requests
- Memory usage SHALL remain under 100MB during peak operation

### Security
- All Azure API communications SHALL be routed through the Service Worker for credential protection
- Inter-component messaging SHALL validate message sources and content
- Storage operations SHALL implement proper access controls and data validation
- External API calls SHALL be properly validated and rate-limited

### Reliability
- Service Worker SHALL recover gracefully from unexpected termination
- Job state SHALL persist across browser restarts and extension updates
- System SHALL handle Chrome quota limitations and storage constraints
- Error recovery SHALL not result in duplicate job processing

### Usability
- Job progress SHALL be immediately visible across all extension interfaces
- System errors SHALL provide actionable feedback to users
- Background processing SHALL not impact browser or system performance
- Extension SHALL remain responsive during heavy transcription workloads
