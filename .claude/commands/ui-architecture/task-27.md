2. WHEN multiple jobs are active THEN the system SHALL show individual progress for each transcription with clear identification
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested resolution actions
4. WHEN jobs complete THEN the system SHALL show completion notifications with summary preview options

### Requirement 4: Meeting Summary Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want well-organized displays of meeting summaries, action items, and key decisions, so that I can quickly review and act on meeting outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying summaries THEN the system SHALL organize content into sections for overview, key points, action items, and decisions
2. WHEN showing action items THEN the system SHALL highlight assigned parties, deadlines, and priority levels with visual indicators
3. WHEN presenting transcriptions THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, scrollable text with speaker identification and timestamps
4. WHEN exporting content THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including text, structured data, and printable summaries

### Requirement 5: Responsive Design System

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual design that works well across different screen sizes and interface contexts, so that the extension looks professional and functions properly everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- State management SHALL persist across popup open/close cycles
- System SHALL work consistently across supported browser versions

### Usability
- Interface SHALL follow modern design principles with clear visual hierarchy
- Loading states SHALL provide meaningful feedback during operations
- Error messages SHALL be user-friendly with actionable guidance
- Navigation SHALL be intuitive with clear information architecture

### Design
# Design Document

## Overview

The UI Architecture design provides a comprehensive React-based user interface system for the Meeting Summarizer extension, implementing responsive design principles with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. This system includes popup interfaces, options pages, progress monitoring, and meeting summary displays that create a cohesive and professional user experience.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)
- **React Framework**: Uses documented React 19.1.1 with TypeScript for component development
- **Styling System**: Implements documented Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 integration patterns
- **State Management**: Follows documented React hooks with Chrome Storage API integration
- **UI Components**: Builds upon documented packages/ui component library

### Project Structure (structure.md)
- **Component Organization**: Follows documented PascalCase naming and component directory structure
- **Page Structure**: Extends documented pages/ organization for popup and options interfaces
- **Styling Configuration**: Uses documented Tailwind configuration hierarchy
- **Import Patterns**: Implements documented absolute imports and barrel exports

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage
- **UI Package Components**: Extend packages/ui/lib/components with meeting-specific interfaces
- **Popup Structure**: Build upon pages/popup/src existing React application structure
- **Options Structure**: Extend pages/options/src with meeting configuration interfaces
- **Shared Hooks**: Use packages/shared/lib/hooks for storage integration and state management

### Integration Points
- **Background Service**: Integrate with Service Worker for real-time job status updates
- **Storage System**: Connect with enhanced storage for meeting data and configuration access
- **Content Scripts**: Coordinate with injected UI elements for consistent user experience
- **Azure Integration**: Provide configuration interfaces for Azure Speech API setup
