# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Testing & Quality Assurance System provides comprehensive testing coverage for the Meeting Summarizer extension, ensuring reliability, performance, and compatibility across browsers and environments. This system includes unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and quality assurance processes that maintain enterprise-grade standards.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This testing system directly supports the product vision by:
- **Enterprise Reliability**: Ensures the extension meets corporate standards for stability and reliability
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Validates consistent functionality across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
- **Quality Assurance**: Maintains high standards for transcription accuracy and user experience
- **Continuous Delivery**: Enables confident releases through comprehensive automated testing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unit Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all components and services, so that I can develop with confidence and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL use React Testing Library with >90% component coverage
2. WHEN testing TypeScript services THEN the system SHALL use Jest with >85% code coverage for business logic
3. WHEN testing Azure integration THEN the system SHALL use mocked API responses to test all success and failure scenarios
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL complete unit test suite in under 30 seconds with clear failure reporting

### Requirement 2: Integration Testing Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that verify component interactions and data flow, so that I can ensure the system works correctly as a whole.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing storage integration THEN the system SHALL verify data persistence and retrieval across different storage layers
2. WHEN testing Azure API integration THEN the system SHALL test authentication, job submission, and result processing workflows
3. WHEN testing background service communication THEN the system SHALL verify message passing between extension components
4. WHEN testing content detection THEN the system SHALL validate URL extraction and meeting metadata parsing

### Requirement 3: End-to-End Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated E2E tests that validate complete user workflows, so that I can ensure the extension works correctly in real browser environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing transcription workflow THEN the system SHALL automate the complete flow from content detection to summary generation
2. WHEN testing cross-browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL run identical test scenarios on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox
3. WHEN testing SharePoint integration THEN the system SHALL validate extension behavior on real SharePoint pages with test content
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and user feedback for common failure cases

### Requirement 4: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to perform reliably under various conditions and loads, so that it remains responsive during heavy usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing extension startup THEN the system SHALL verify initialization completes within performance requirements
2. WHEN testing concurrent transcriptions THEN the system SHALL validate performance with multiple simultaneous jobs
3. WHEN testing memory usage THEN the system SHALL monitor for memory leaks and excessive resource consumption
4. WHEN testing large files THEN the system SHALL verify reliable handling of 2-hour meeting transcriptions

### Requirement 5: Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want comprehensive quality metrics and monitoring, so that I can ensure the extension meets quality standards and user expectations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN measuring transcription accuracy THEN the system SHALL provide metrics comparing Azure results with known test data
2. WHEN monitoring user experience THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics and error rates across different scenarios
3. WHEN validating accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines and screen reader compatibility
4. WHEN assessing security THEN the system SHALL verify proper handling of sensitive data and API credentials

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Test suite execution SHALL complete within 5 minutes for full regression testing
- Unit tests SHALL run in parallel with maximum 8 concurrent processes
- E2E tests SHALL include performance assertions with specific timing requirements
- Test reporting SHALL generate within 30 seconds of test completion

### Security
- Test data SHALL never include real API keys or sensitive corporate information
- Mock services SHALL properly simulate security scenarios without exposing credentials
- Test environment SHALL be isolated from production Azure services
- Automated tests SHALL validate security controls and data protection measures

### Reliability
- Test suite SHALL achieve >95% reliability with consistent results across environments
- Flaky tests SHALL be identified and addressed within 24 hours of detection
- Test data SHALL be properly managed and cleaned up after test execution
- Cross-browser tests SHALL account for browser-specific timing and behavior differences

### Usability
- Test results SHALL provide clear, actionable feedback for failures
- Test reports SHALL include screenshots and detailed logs for E2E test failures
- Continuous integration SHALL provide immediate feedback on test status
- Test documentation SHALL be comprehensive and easy to follow for new developers
